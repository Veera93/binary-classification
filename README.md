# Binary Classification
The objective of this project is to implement a convolutional neural network to determine whether a person is wearing glasses or not.
Data set used is CelebA dataset 

This is a binary classification problem using the CelebA dataset. The convolutional neural network was implemented using Tensorflow. In this project, the model was trained with varying layers (7,9, and 11 layers), used dropout for regularization, and changed the resolution of the images for a one channel model. For a three channel model, an optimal architecture for classification based on the CIFAR-10 model implementation for object classification was implemented.
